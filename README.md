# KAN-5-Create-a-basic-calculator

Building a calculator app
→ How it must work? 
There must be a function:

calculate (string)

E.g 3 + 1 + 3

What the app can do:

+, -, *, ÷

It can take a long sum.

TDD: Create Unit test:

Write a test to test the calculate function with the following (+, -, *, ÷)

Each operator must be its own test method.
